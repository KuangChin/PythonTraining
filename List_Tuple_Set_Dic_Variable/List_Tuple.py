### List (Ordered, Changable)
# grades = [12, 60, 15, 70, 90]
# grades[0] = 55 # Changable
# print(grades, grades[4], grades[1:4])
# grades[1:4] = [] # Delete sequence data
# print(grades)

# grades = grades + [12, 33]
# print(grades, len(grades))

# data = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
# print(data[0], data[0][1], data[0][0:2])
# data[0][0:2] = [3,3,3]
# print(data)

### Tuple (Ordered, Non-changable)
## Same operation as List, only non-changable
# data = (3,4,5)
# print(data[2], data[0:2])

# data[0] = 5 #Error: non-changable
# print(data)
